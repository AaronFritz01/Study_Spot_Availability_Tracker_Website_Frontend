      Purdue University has now seen the largest incoming class for Fall 2021
      with more than 10,000 freshmen enrolling. Due to the added volume of
      people, it is becoming increasingly time-consuming for students to find
      places to study, even though there are plenty of vacant spaces around the
      West Lafayette campus. We propose the 'Study Spot Availability Tracker', a
      system that monitors seat occupancy in buildings that have a place to
      study. The tracker will detect the availability of each seat and display
      its occupancy through a web environment and mobile friendly site.
      Developments that our team has made over the Spring 2022 semester were to
      utilize detection with the combination of multiple sensors, such 1)
      Ultrasonic with passive infrared (PIR) sensor and 2) infrared thermal
      sensor with PIR sensor. By modifying the conditions from the previous
      design, we expect to have improvements in accuracy. Furthermore, to make
      this possible, we will implement our solution by producing hardware,
      including custom PCB design for sensor circuits and 3D printed casing that
      will fit the sensors and electrical components. Our website will be hosted
      by Purdue and developed using the Vue framework, with a python based
      back-end, and a MySQL or real-time database. It will interact with the
      constellation of detectors to gather and display occupancy data in a
      user-friendly and visually appealing website.
